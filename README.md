For source control, I have used a private Github repo.<br>
It requires a README. Here it is.

### FAQ

#####Why did you change the Makefile, Zach?

I have added two commands to the Makefile to help with development,<br>
`make clean` and `make again`. Beyond that, I have made no other changes to the Makefile.

#####So, you went and made a Github repo for this. Isn't that against EECS policy maybe?

Yes, that was a thing back in EECS168/268 wasn't it? Well the good news is<br>
the repository I am committing and pushing to is private - only I am<br>
able to grant people access. If anyone is concerned about sharing code,<br>
that would be impossible to accomplish without my express knowledge.

Additionally, I have found nothing in the syllabus which would forbid<br>
me from doing this. However, at the request of the course instructor or<br>
any EECS administrator I would be happy to remove this project from Github.

#####What changes were made from the template?

Check the revision history.

#####How do I run this?

First compile it with `make`. This compiles fine for me on the Linux EECS machines.<br>
I have provided the two given sample files in this repo. They can be tested with<br>
`./main samples/iris.txt` and `./main samples/AndrewsTable1.txt`

#####Don't you figure this readme is getting a bit too long for something one person will maybe read?

Good point. I'll stop.
